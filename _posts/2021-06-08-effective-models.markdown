It is not a news that Earth is round. However, we all have heard about the [*flat earth society*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_flat_Earth_beliefs#International_Flat_Earth_Research_Society). Many think of flat earth society as a bunch of people with low intelligence. I perconally find them interesting. Not because I think that earth is flat or anything. But because of the ways how flat earth believers think. Debates with flat earth belivers is never easy one and you get frustrated why its hard to convince them of a such seemingly simple fact. "Earth is round, duh!" In many cases, they can give solid reasoning why they believe in flat earth. They can "debunk" round earth. And obviously they have rasons to think why earth is flat. For example, they see the earth around them. It looks flat. Why not extent this idea. It is simple. It is true. It works well everywhere.

Except it doesn't.

You may be tempted to think that flat earthers are the type of people who fall into these pitfalls of wrong extrapolation. However, I will give more examples of how one of the smartest people in the world did these errors again and again throughout history. No one of us is safe from making such errors. This note is to remind myself, that extrapolation can get really wrong and really fast.


When Isaac Newton wrote his famous [*principia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophi%C3%A6_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica) he did not know that speed of light was limited. He believed in ideas that modern physics already abandoned. That is: absolute space and time. He believed that poth space and time should be uniform and absolute. It made perfect sense during his time. Basically, he thought that there should be an absolute point in space and time. Sort of a "time zero" and "ground zero". All the objects can be described with respect to this absolute reference frame accurately. First person to opose Newtons idea was Gottfried Leibniz. Leibniz believed that the space makes only sence with respect to other things. And time makes sense in a continuum of events. Remember, both of the ideas were not revolutionary new. Both existed long before. Newtons laws of dynamics made perfect sense in the absolute frame and absolute time. 

The debate about space and time settled, when first measurements of the speed of light were tested. Speed of light is constant no matter of the speed of the reference frame. For example, it doesn't matter if you measure speed of light inside the rocked that is moving with the half of the speed of light with respect to earth or on the surface of the earth. Both observers measure speed of time to be same.

How? Even if physically both lights seem to travel different distance, then the time does not pass uniformly. Time is relative. Space is relative. Time can be stretched. Space can be stretched. Space and Time can be curved ( which generates gravity, by the way). Simultaneously happening events with some distance are not simultanious in every frame of reference. 

These were findings of Albert Einstein. He was able to predict much complex events with general relativity. Included and not limited to black holes, expansion of universe and gravitational waves. Relationship between general relativity and special relativity similar to the idea of curved earth and flat earth. And relationship between general relativity and Newtons physics is that Newtons physics is special case of general relativity. There are more constrains in Newtons physics than in general relativity. It means that Newtons physics is more compact. 

Newtons physics is not abandoned with the discovery of general relativity. We just simply know that it is not a whole story. We also know that general relativity is not a whole story too! There is a quantum gravity that is missing from quantum physics and that is where Einsteins model fail us: in a small scales. 

There is a general pattern with any model. When you try to extrapolate some model outside the observation, you instantly get crushed by the break of some sort of a symmetry. Let's agree. Flat earth or flat surface is very simple. It's nice and comforting. Learning that earth is not flat is somehow makes everything complicated. Same goes with general relativity. Knowing that time passes differently at different places in space is also not comforting at all. Some people tell how they feel anxiety when they learn general relativity. Anxiety increases when you learn quantum physics. And there are numerous of very stressed scientists who are trying to marry these two ideas. 

I believe that it is something of a law. It is a blessing and curse of an intelligence. We can store some information in a compact form with exchange of not being right overall, but for daily tasks it does not matter. Higher accuracy requires suffistication. This is a tradeoff between simplicity and complexity. 

Therefore, I believe in an effective models. I don't think that any models are "more" correct than others. Each models should have some boundaries and constraints to be simplified. Instead of trying to find general model which is going to be computationally intractable, it is better to spend more effort on effective models. It does not makes sense to think of models as being true. None of the models can be absolutely true. Each models have limitations. This limitations create opportunity for simplification. More constraints are present - simpler model you need to describe it. The more general concept you want to grasp - more computation you need to spend on it.
