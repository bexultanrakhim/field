<h4> About me</h4>
<p>
    My name is Bexultan and I am robotics engineer. I work at company that develops self driving cars and
    autonomous robots. Before that, I did research in robotics and machine learning. My work is related to the 
    topics like <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory">control theory,</a>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">reinforcement learning,</a>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision"> computer vision</a></em>. 
    My interests are: natural sciences, philosophy of mind, cognitive sciences and linguistics. 
    At my free time, I develop small scale AI bots.
</p>
<p>
    I like to write about my observations and share my thoughts with my friends. Sometimes I can spend all
    night reading research papers and in the morning start spamming my friends about some extremely controversial
    ideas (yes, I am aware they are controversial). I think of it as a stimulus to brain to think critically.
</p>
<p>
    This is how I came up with idea to create a blog.
</p>
<h4> My experience with blogs</h4>
<p>
    I've tried to create blogs before. But I did not even imagine how hard it is to write nice and 
    comprehensive text. Many times I've done same mistakes of over-complicating things or over-simplifying. 
    Previously I have tried to write about philosophy, attempt that makes me feel ashamed. 
    Needless to say, it was overconfidence in my knowledge and 
    abilities. For this reason, I will abstain from writing on topcis I am not 
    familiar with.
</p>
<p>
    I want to create very nice blog of my thoughts. To save my knowledge in a way, that is manageable 
    and easily accessible to everyone. There are so many things I want to document. 
</p>
<p>
    My mind is filled with a lot of information. But recently, I started to forget. Time is really merciless. 
    These might be my futile efforts to save something about me.
</p>
<p>
    You can thing of this blog as my
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_cognition">cognitive offloading</a>. 
    I am uploading the here all my knowledge. I hope some of you find it useful in a way. 
</p>
<h4>What is the plan?</h4>
<p>
    This is a blog, so I am writing anythings that is of my interest. I will be modifying 
    older posts by editing possible errors and managing new content in a form of a blog. Send me message if
    you see any errors! Each blog will be assigned 4 digit number.
    Sort of a way to distinguish them in a temporal order.
</p>
<p class="mb-5">Let's begin this long road together...
